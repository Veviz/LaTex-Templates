# Latex Templates

# Intruduction

Latex is really a better file editing tools than Microsoft Office. Though the MS Office has an advantage of WYSIWYG, its disadvantage is also obvious. For example, when you want to change some place, but MS think you want to change some place else and help you do some changes you don't need at all. That's disgusting for me and it make me search for other tools to replace it. Meanwhile, MS can only work on Windows X system, but sometimes I need work in Linux system, which pushes me to search for other tools. Then, I found the Latex.

This repository stores the Latex templates I've used. We don't need to write a file from nothing when we're using Latex. There are a lot Latex templates and we just need to change some place to let it suitable for your file. Thus, I spent some time organizing my Latex documents or learning from others and got these Latex Templates. I wish it can be helpful for those needed.
